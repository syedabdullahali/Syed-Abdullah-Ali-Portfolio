My Personal Portfolio
About This Project

This is a simple portfolio website I created using only HTML and CSS.
The goal was to build a clean, one-page layout that introduces me, shows some of my projects, and provides a way to get in touch.

What’s Inside

Header → My name and a short tagline

Navigation → Links to About, Projects, and Contact sections

About Section → A short introduction about me and EXP

Projects Section → Two sample projects with a title, description, and a link

Contact Section → A basic form with name and email fields

Design Choices

I decided to use a dark background with golden accents because it creates a nice contrast and is easier on the eyes.

Here are the colors I used in my CSS variables

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: rgb(44, 45, 54);
  --bg-color-secondry: rgb(57, 58, 68);
  --color-primary: rgb(223, 173, 35);
  --color-secondry: rgb(233, 195, 91);
  --color-gray-primary: rgb(244, 243, 243);
  --color-gray-secondry: rgb(218, 215, 215);
  --color-gray-third: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.288);
}
```



Dark background → modern and professional look

Golden highlights → make important elements stand out

Gray tones → good for text and secondary details

I also used flexbox for layout and kept the typography simple for better readability.
